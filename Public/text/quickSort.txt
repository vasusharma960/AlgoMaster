Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach where
-An array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element (element selected from the array).
-While dividing the array, the pivot element should be positioned in such a way that elements less than pivot are kept on the left side and elements greater than pivot are on the right side of the pivot.
-The left and right subarrays are also divided using the same approach. This process continues until each subarray contains a single element.
-At this point, elements are already sorted. Finally, elements are combined to form a sorted array.

Working of Quicksort Algorithm
1. Select the Pivot Element
There are different variations of quicksort where the pivot element is selected from different positions. Here, we will be selecting the rightmost element of the array as the pivot element.
2. Rearrange the Array
Now the elements of the array are rearranged so that elements that are smaller than the pivot are put on the left and the elements greater than the pivot are put on the right.
3. Divide Subarrays
Pivot elements are again chosen for the left and the right sub-parts separately. And, step 2 is repeated.

quickSort(array, leftmostIndex, rightmostIndex)
  if (leftmostIndex < rightmostIndex)
    pivotIndex <- partition(array,leftmostIndex, rightmostIndex)
    quickSort(array, leftmostIndex, pivotIndex - 1)
    quickSort(array, pivotIndex, rightmostIndex)

partition(array, leftmostIndex, rightmostIndex)
  set rightmostIndex as pivotIndex
  storeIndex <- leftmostIndex - 1
  for i <- leftmostIndex + 1 to rightmostIndex
  if element[i] < pivotElement
    swap element[i] and element[storeIndex]
    storeIndex++
  swap pivotElement and element[storeIndex+1]
return storeIndex + 1
